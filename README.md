# Epigenetic memories inscribed in chromatin accessibility in aged hematopoietic stem cells
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit considerable cell-intrinsic changes with age. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of aged HSCs and downstream progenitors. All original data have been deposited in NCBI, and the codes used for the analyses are described here.
