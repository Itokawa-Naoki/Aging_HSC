# Epigenetic memories inscribed in chromatin accessibility in aged hematopoietic stem cells
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit considerable cell-intrinsic changes with age. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptome(RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility(ATAC-seq) of young and aged HSCs and downstream progenitors.  
All original data have been deposited in NCBI(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE162662), and the codes used for the analyses are stored in this repository.
